Command to list the external facing ports (handy when adding an app to confirm you do not try to use one that is already occupied.)

This works for running containers
docker container ls --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}" -a

I should finde and add what works for existing but downed containers.
